            <h1>Above All</h1>
            <h5><span>by</span> Michael W. Smith</h5>
        <p>Above all powers<br>
            Above all kings<br>
            Above all nature<br>
            And all created things<br>
            Above all wisdom<br>
            And all the ways of man<br>
            You were here<br>
            Before the world began</p>

        <p>Above all kingdoms<br>
            Above all thrones<br>
            Above all wonders<br>
            The world has ever known<br>
            Above all wealth<br>
            And treasures of the earth<br>
            There's no way to measure<br>
            What You're worth</p>

        <p>CHORUS <br>
            Crucified<br>
            Laid behind the stone<br>
            You lived to die<br>
            Rejected and alone<br>
            Like a rose<br>
            Trampled on the ground<br>
            You took the fall<br>
            And thought of me<br>
            Above all</p>
    </div>
</body>
